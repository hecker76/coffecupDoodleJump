Java Project, Doodle Jump recreation

In Doodle Jump, the aim is to guide "The Doodler" 
up a never-ending series of platforms without falling. The left side of the playing 
field warps around to the right side. For devices with an accelerometer, players tilt
the device from side to side to move the Doodler in the desired direction. In a computer, press the 
right and left arrow keys.
